## Resources
* [Visually Hidden](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169) I used boilerplate code to remove headings that created html structure, but were not visually necessary.

## Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project
and in the syllabus.

## Comments
* This was a long one, but the walkthrough was great and made for an very good learning experience.
